Let's walk through setting up a single rqlite node using Docker Compose.

[Single-node database](https://github.com/rqlite/docker-compose/tree/master/rqliteSingleNode) source code.


## Step-by-Step Setup


### 1. Project directory `rqliteSingleNode`

Folder, `rqliteSingleNode` is where your `compose.yaml` file will reside.

```bash
$ mkdir -p rqliteSingleNode
$ cd rqliteSingleNode
```


### 2. Create the data persistence folder

rqlite needs a place to store its data.
We'll create a local folder named `rqlite-data` that will be mounted into the container.

```bash
$ mkdir -p rqlite-data
```


### 3. Review the `rqliteSingleNode` `compose.yaml` file

File [compose.yaml](https://github.com/rqlite/docker-compose/blob/master/rqliteSingleNode/compose.yaml) defines our single rqlite service.
Take a look at its contents:

```bash
$ cat compose.yaml
```

```yaml
# Created: 2025-06-13 23:47:19
# Updated:
# Language: Docker Compose version v2.36.2
# Images:
#    - rqlite/rqlite:8.37.4
# Project: rqlite Single-Node

name: rqliteSingleNode

services:

  myrqlite-service-1:
    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest
    container_name: myrqlite-container-1
    hostname: myrqlite-host-1
    volumes:
      - ./rqlite-data/myrqlite-node-1:/rqlite/file
    ports:
      - "4001:4001"
      - "4002:4002"
    environment:
      NODE_ID: myrqlite-node-1
      HTTP_ADDR: myrqlite-host-1:4001
      RAFT_ADDR: myrqlite-host-1:4002
      SQLITE_EXTENSIONS: "sqlean,sqlite-vec,misc"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "-q", "-O", "/dev/null", "http://myrqlite-host-1:4001/status"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s
```


### 4. Launch the rqlite service

Use `docker compose up -d` to build, create, start, and attach to the container in **detached mode**.
This means the container will run in the background.

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

```


### 5. Verify the service status

Check that your rqlite container is running and healthy using `docker compose ps`.

```bash
$ docker compose ps
```

```text
NAME                   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  SERVICE              CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS
myrqlite-container-1   rqlite/rqlite:latest   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   myrqlite-service-1   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:4001-4002->4001-4002/tcp, [::]:4001-4002->4001-4002/tcp
```


### 6. Inspect the service logs

To see what's happening inside your rqlite container, check its logs.
This is useful for troubleshooting or confirming the service started correctly.

```bash
$ docker compose logs
```

```text

```


### 7. Interact with rqlite using the command-line tool

You can directly access the rqlite CLI inside the running container.

```bash
$ docker exec -it myrqlite-container-1 rqlite -H myrqlite-host-1
```

```sql
Welcome to the rqlite CLI.
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to http://myrqlite-host-1:4001 running version v8.37.4
myrqlite-host-1:4001>
```


### 8. Perform database operations

Now that you're connected to the rqlite CLI, you can create tables, insert data, and query it just like you would with SQLite.

```sql
myrqlite-host-1:4001> .timer on
myrqlite-host-1:4001> CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)
1 row affected (0.000000 sec)
Run Time: 0.000000 seconds
myrqlite-host-1:4001> INSERT INTO foo(name) VALUES ('Fiona'), ('Philip'), ('Olivier')
3 rows affected (0.000000 sec)
Run Time: 0.000000 seconds
myrqlite-host-1:4001> SELECT * FROM foo
+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Fiona   |
+----+---------+
| 2  | Philip  |
+----+---------+
| 3  | Olivier |
+----+---------+
Run Time: 0.000343 seconds
myrqlite-host-1:4001> .exit
```


### 9. Stop and clean up the service

When you're finished, `docker compose down` will stop the containers and remove the containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `docker compose up`.

```bash
$ docker compose down
```

```text
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Container myrqlite-container-1    Removed            0.4s
 ✔ Network rqlitesinglenode_default  Removed            0.4s
```
