---

This guide demonstrates how to set up an automatically configured three-node rqlite cluster using Docker Compose.
The automatic clustering feature simplifies the initial configuration, allowing new nodes to discover and join the existing cluster with minimal manual intervention.
The setup explicitly instructs each joining node to connect to existing nodes, ensuring a robust and self-forming cluster.

[Automatic clustering with 3 nodes](https://github.com/rqlite/docker-compose/tree/master/rqliteAutomaticClustering) source code.

## Step-by-Step Setup


### 1. Project directory `rqliteAutomaticClustering`

The entire setup is contained within a dedicated `rqliteAutomaticClustering` folder, which will house the `compose.yaml` file.

```bash
$ mkdir -p rqliteAutomaticClustering
$ cd rqliteAutomaticClustering
```


### 2. Create the data persistence folder

A `rqlite-data` directory is created to ensure data persistence for each rqlite node.
The `compose.yaml` file configures separate subfolders within `rqlite-data` for each node (e.g., `./rqlite-data/myrqlite-node-1`), which is crucial for preventing data conflicts and maintaining individual node states.

```bash
$ mkdir -p rqlite-data
```


### 3. Review the `rqliteAutomaticClustering` `compose.yaml` file

File [compose.yaml](https://github.com/rqlite/docker-compose/blob/master/rqliteAutomaticClustering/compose.yaml) defines our three rqlite services, `myrqlite-service-1`, `myrqlite-service-2`, and `myrqlite-service-3`.
Notice how `myrqlite-service-1`, `myrqlite-service-2` and `myrqlite-service-3` use the `-join` command to connect together.
Command `-bootstrap-expect` and `-join`: This is the core of the automatic clustering.
`-bootstrap-expect 3` flag tells each node to wait until 3 nodes are present before attempting to form a cluster.
This helps prevent split-brain scenarios in a multi-node setup.
`-join myrqlite-service-1:4002,myrqlite-service-2:4002,myrqlite-service-3:4002` instructs each node to attempt to join the cluster via the specified raft addresses of the other nodes.
Docker Compose's internal DNS resolution allows nodes to refer to each other by their service names.
Take a look at its contents:

```bash
$ cat compose.yaml
```

```yaml

### 4. Launch the rqlite service

Using docker `compose up -d` brings up all three rqlite services in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.
The output clearly shows the image pulling and container startup process.

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

### 5. Verify the service status

`docker compose ps` command is essential for confirming that all containers are running as expected, along with their exposed ports.

```bash
$ docker compose ps
```

```text
NAME                   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  SERVICE              CREATED         STATUS         PORTS

```


### 6. Inspect the cluster logs

The combined logs provide valuable insight into the cluster formation process.
You can observe messages related to node starting, joining attempts, successful bootstrapping, and leader election.
The logs clearly show myrqlite-node-3 becoming the leader in this particular run.

```bash
$ docker compose logs
```

### 7. Interact with rqlite using the command-line tool

The guide demonstrates how to connect to the rqlite CLI within a running container and interact with the database.
The example shows connecting to `myrqlite-host-3` via `myrqlite-container-1`, highlighting that any node can be used to perform operations as changes are replicated across the cluster.

```bash
$ docker exec -it myrqlite-container-1 rqlite -H myrqlite-host-3
```

```sql
Welcome to the rqlite CLI.
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to http://myrqlite-host-3:4001 running version v8.37.4
myrqlite-host-3:4001>
```


### 8. Perform database operations

The example of creating a table and inserting data confirms that the cluster is functional and that data replication is occurring.

```sql
myrqlite-host-3:4001> .timer on
myrqlite-host-3:4001> CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)
1 row affected (0.000000 sec)
Run Time: 0.000000 seconds
myrqlite-host-3:4001> INSERT INTO foo(name) VALUES ('Fiona'), ('Philip'), ('Olivier')
3 rows affected (0.000000 sec)
Run Time: 0.000000 seconds
myrqlite-host-3:4001> SELECT * FROM foo
+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Fiona   |
+----+---------+
| 2  | Philip  |
+----+---------+
| 3  | Olivier |
+----+---------+
Run Time: 0.000114 seconds
myrqlite-host-3:4001> .exit
```


### 9. Stop and clean up the service

This command gracefully stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `compose.yaml` file, ensuring a clean tear down of the environment.

```bash
$ docker compose down
```

```text
[+] Running 4/4
 ✔ Container myrqlite-container-1             Removed                                     0.7s
 ✔ Container myrqlite-container-2             Removed                                     0.5s

```
